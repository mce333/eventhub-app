# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

TEST 3 ✅ Second expense (Otros, S/600) registers correctly - both expenses show, total = S/1,450. localStorage.demo_events contains both expenses with correct data. Core functionality WORKING. MINOR ISSUE: main.tsx clears demo_events on new session start (line 8), preventing cross-session visibility. Admin cannot see Juan's expenses in new session.

ISSUES FOUND: 1) Auto-calculation NOT working - Total field shows '0' instead of calculated value (cantidad * precio). When filling form with JavaScript, onChange/onInput events do not trigger the calculation logic. 2) Expense persistence FAILING - After clicking 'Registrar Gasto', expense does NOT appear in 'Gastos Adicionales' list. localStorage shows 0 gastos, indicating expense is NOT being saved. 3) The handleAddExpense function in EventExpensesTab.tsx (lines 84-174) appears to save to localStorage, but the expense is not persisting. Tested on event ID 1001 'Boda de Rosa y Miguel' with foodDetails present.

The handleSubmit function in CreateEventModal.tsx (lines 140-286) should save event to localStorage and redirect to /eventos, but this is failing.

RESULTS: ✅ FASE 1 (Data Cleanup): localStorage.clear() executed but initializeSampleEvents() runs on every page load, so 10 sample events persist. ✅ FASE 2 (Event Creation with Beverages): Successfully created event 'Boda de Juan y María' with 3 beverages (Gaseosa: 50×S/5, Agua: 100×S/2, Vino: 20×S/45). All beverages registered correctly and appear in modal with green checkmarks. Event saved to localStorage with ID 1761964985197. ✅ FASE 4 (Gastos Tab Access): Event opens correctly, Gastos tab accessible, Bebidas section shows 'Bebidas: S/ 1,350.00' confirming beverages were saved. ❌ FASE 4 (Add Beverage): Test failed when trying to add Champán - could not find beverage type selector. The Bebidas section appears collapsed with 'Cancelar' button visible. ⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING: The 3 beverages (Gaseosa, Agua, Vino) created during event creation are NOT visible in the Gastos > Bebidas section when expanded. The section shows 'Bebidas: S/ 1,350.00' in the summary but individual beverages are not listed. This suggests beverages are saved but not displayed in the Gastos tab UI. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent should verify EventExpensesTab.tsx beverage display logic and ensure beverages from event.beverages array are properly rendered in the Bebidas section."
